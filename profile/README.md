# MISERY Trainer — When Survival Becomes a Discipline

In **MISERY**, the world does not care about comfort. Hunger gnaws, radiation whispers, and every bullet is a decision weighted with consequence. The **MISERY Trainer** was created not to soften this cruelty, but to help you *understand it*.
Think of it as a quiet notebook carried through the Zone — a way to observe, test, and refine your survival instincts without breaking immersion.

## 🌫 Overview

MISERY Trainer is a **Windows-based enhancement tool** designed specifically for the MISERY overhaul. It provides modular control over survival mechanics, combat pressure, and environmental awareness — all while respecting the brutal philosophy of the mod.

It is used by:

* Newcomers learning MISERY’s unforgiving systems
* Veterans testing builds and difficulty curves
* Explorers who want insight without removing danger

Nothing is forced. Everything is optional.

## 👁 Environmental Awareness & ESP

The Zone lies by omission. The trainer helps you read between its silences.

* NPC and mutant highlights with distance fade
* Stash and loot container visibility
* Artifact detection radius overlay
* Trap and anomaly indicators
* Adjustable colors for fog, night, and storms

These tools don’t shout — they murmur, preserving tension.

## 🔫 Combat & Weapon Control

Gunfights in MISERY are brief, decisive, and terrifying. The trainer offers *measured refinement*:

* Recoil stabilization (configurable per weapon)
* Spread and sway tuning for realism testing
* Ammo consumption control
* Optional damage scaling for sandbox runs
* Ballistics visualization for long-range engagements

Not invincibility — *consistency*.
